# My_Thesis
Project development for my thesis

This is a python project for my thesis.

The idea, is to gather tweets from Twitter with the help of Twitter REST APIs, Search and Streaming APIs. Then all
data will go into a MongoDB for storing purposes. Finally, through a GUI, the user will be able to see some statistics or
data analysis by applying some filters with queries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SPECS:

to be able to run this program you need to add a file.

First you must make an app in https://apps.twitter.com/
and find your API key (consumer key) and API secret along with Access Token and Access Token Secret.

When you'll finish this, go to the project home folder (for example C:\path to folder\My_Thesis\) and create a
text file with name <credentials.txt>

Add the following into the text file:

consumer_key:

consumer_secret:

access_token:

access_token_secret:

and add after the ":" your personal tokens

IMPORTANT:

make sure, not to publish your personal tokens
