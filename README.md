Project development for my thesis

This is a python project for my thesis.

The idea, is to gather tweets from Twitter with the help of Twitter REST APIs, Search and Streaming APIs. Then all
data will go into a MongoDB for storing purposes. Finally, through a GUI, the user will be able to see some statistics or
data analysis by applying some filters with queries.
