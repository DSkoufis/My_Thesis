# My_Thesis
Project development for my thesis

This is a python project for my thesis.

The idea, is to gather tweets from Twitter with the help of Twitter REST APIs, Search and Streaming. Then all
data will go into a MongoDB instance for storing purposes. Finally, through a GUI, the user will be able to see some statistics or
data analysis by applying some filters.


# SPECS:

To be able to run this program there are some TO-DOs:

First you must make a Twitter account and then create an app from https://apps.twitter.com/
and find your API key (consumer key) and API secret along with Access Token and Access Token Secret.

When finished, go to ../My_Thesis/Ufiles/credentials.json and open it with a text editor like Notepad++. Complete your newly acquired 
credentials, as names state. 

Secondly, make sure you have installed Python3.5. There are some dependencies for this project to run, but I will add a requirements file
in a later stage.


# IMPORTANT:

Make sure, NOT to publish your personal tokens
