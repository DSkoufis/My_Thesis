# My_Thesis
Project development for my thesis

This is a python project for my thesis.

The idea, is to gather tweets from Twitter with the help of Twitter REST APIs, Search and Streaming. Then all
data will go into a MongoDB instance for storing purposes. Finally, through a GUI, the user will be able to see some statistics or
data analysis by applying some filters.


# SPECS:

To be able to run this program there are some TO-DOs.

First you must make a Twitter account and then create an app from https://apps.twitter.com/
and find your API key (consumer key) and API secret along with Access Token and Access Token Secret.

When you'll finish this, go to the project home folder (for example C:\path to folder\My_Thesis\) and create a
text file with name <credentials.txt>.

Add the following into the newly created text file:

-----------------------------------------
consumer_key:

consumer_secret:

access_token:

access_token_secret:

-----------------------------------------

and after the ":" complete your personal credentials.

# IMPORTANT:

Make sure, NOT to publish your personal tokens
